###Additional Report:
For the third third report of my choice, I decided to showcase the number of customers (that are incorporated into the customers table) per country. The different country options are the U.S., U.K., and Canada. To obtain this particular data, I pulled customer and country data from the database, and created a customer/country relation method to ensure the information was accurate and correctly placed in the table.
